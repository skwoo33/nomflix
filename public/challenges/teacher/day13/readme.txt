# Infinite Scrolling

Using everything that you know, create a page that calls an API with infinite scrolling.
It should behave like this:



API Documentation: https://yts.lt/api#list_movies

Clues:
ï»¿This is how I would make the API file.
The URL would end up looking something like this:
https://yts.lt/api/v2/list_movies.json?page=1&limit=50




Requirements:
Don't use Class Components.
Use only hooks.
When the user reaches the end of the page, request more movies (other page)
No Container/Presenter.
All functionality should remain the same.
